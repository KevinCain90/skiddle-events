    "description": "The Amazing Kappa Band\r\n \r\nPaul Kappa, Maria Alan and Laura Gilchrist.\r\n \r\nMaybe one of the best bands you've never heard of.\r\n  \r\nFor the last thirteen years Amazing Kappe Band has held a twice weekly residency in Liverpool's famous Cavern Pub and Club on Mathew Street,  thrilling and exciting a local and  international crowd of literally thousands a week.\r\n \r\nThere is now a brick in the wall of fame there on Mathew Street; honouring their contribution to the music scene on the sacred stones of Liverpool's music Mecca.\r\n \r\nThink Led Zeppelin, Jimi Hendrix, Johnny Cash, MotÃ¶rhead, Dolly Parton and Ravel as unlikely bedfellows of influence.\r\nIt's making no sense,  but you'll know what they mean.\r\nThe Amazing Kappa Band draws from a diverse sonic pool, but arrives at it's own distinct conclusions.\r\n \r\nThe mix is eclectic, but amazing, like an old Victorian magician's act (where you ask questions, to test their memory), but considerably better looking, since the band recruited a powerhouse rhythm section of Maria Alan on bass and Laura Gilchrist on drums, with both also singing & writing, adding layers of harmony and artistic depth; you won't see this one coming.\r\n \r\nOriginality? It's there in spades with ten albums of original material behind the band, ready to be thrown into the mix, you won't be able to tell where the classics end and the originals begin.",
